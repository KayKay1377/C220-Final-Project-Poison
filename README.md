# Poison Profiteer
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, November 2021

## Theme
We took the theme literally by name and game. Our game is about manufacturing and selling poisons in order to make more money and repeat the process. It is considered an Idle game in which you mainly let the game simulate the work while you strategize about how to earn the most money the quickest. Therefore, you are literally "picking your poison" to make.
